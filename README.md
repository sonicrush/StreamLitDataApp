Welcome to my example streamlit application!
This app utilizes water data from FIU, and showcases it using Streamlit!
It also has a section utilizing NASA's API to retrieve the Astronomy Picture of the Day!
You will need to supply your own API key by creating a .env file within the root folder, and naming the key "NASA_API_KEY".
